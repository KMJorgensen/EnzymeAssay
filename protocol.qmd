This protocol describes how to estimate potential activities of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes using a fluorescence based method outlined in @saiya-cork2002. In short, soil or litter suspensions are incubated in a solution containing a substrate that can be hydrolyzed by the enzyme you are targeting. At the end of the incubation period, the reaction is stopped by adding NaOH which raises the pH and the hydrolyzed substrate starts to fluoresce. You measure fluorescence on a fluorescence spectrometer, and use standard curves @sec-standard_curve to convert fluorescence to concentrations of product formed.

## Protocol overview

### Before starting the assay

You need to prepare buffer solutions, substrate solutions and stop solutions before starting the assay, see @sec-solution_prep for details and storage times. The preparation of all solutions is quite time consuming so allocate one day for it.

You also need to prepare the soil suspensions in advance. Previous versions of this protocol has said that suspensions should be prepared on the day of the assay but the suspensions seem to be stable for at least a week, so they can be prepared in advance. It is always a good idea to compare activities from a freshly made suspension with a stored one to optimize storage for your particular soil type.

### Doing the assay

The assay is done in black 96-well flat-bottom microplates with four technical replicates of each soil suspension (24 samples/plate). Prepare three identical plates with soil suspensions; one for doing the incubation, one fluorescence control @sec-fluorescence_ctrl and one quenching control @sec-quenching_ctrl.

1.  Pipette 200 µl of the soil suspension into each well (4 replicates/sample)
2.  Pipette 50 µl of enzyme substrate into each well (use multi-channel pipette)
3.  Incubate plate in darkness (cover with aluminium foil)
4.  Stop the reaction by adding 10 µl of 0.5 M NaOH
5.  Measure fluorescence using the following settings:
    -   Excitation wawelength = 365 nm
    -   Excitation slit = 2.5
    -   Emission wavelength = 450 nm
    -   Emission slit = 2.5
    -   Emission filter = 390 nm cut off
    -   Number of measurement cycles = 1
    -   Read time for each well = 1 sec

Alteration fluorescence control:

-   Stop reaction immediately after step 2

Alteration quenching control:

-   Add MUB standard substrate, same concentration as one point from the standard curve (e.g. 9 µM) instead of the enzyme substrate in step 2. Then follow point 3-5.

### Fluorescence control {#sec-fluorescence_ctrl}

The fluorescence control is used to control for any background fluorescence in the soil suspension, by stopping the reaction immediately after adding the enzyme substrate you can measure fluorescence at T~0~. This value is then subtracted from the fluorescence in the incubated sample to calculate "net"-fluorescence:

$$
fluorescence_{net} = incubated - T_0
$$

### Quenching control {#sec-quenching_ctrl}

Quenching is a form of inhibition of fluorescence (e.g. caused by complex formation with the soil in the suspension). You need to test the level of quenching to determine whether your measurements are "ok". You do this by incubating the soil suspensions with a standard solution of MUB or MUC (which are the fluorescent components in the enzyme substrates; see @tab-substrates. A 30-60 min incubation period is usually enough. Calculate the quenching ratio:

$$
quenching = incubated/MUB_{standard}
$$

If the value is \>1, you have no quenching and if it is \<1 there is some quenching. Usually, a value \<0.6 means that there is too much quenching and you may need to dilute the sample and re-run the incubation with a lower soil concentration.

You could also correct for quenching:

$$
fluorescence_{corrected} = fluorescence_{net} \times (1-quenching)
$$

## Preparation of solutions {#sec-solution_prep}

### Sodium acetate buffer (50 mM) {#sec-sodium_acetate}

Sodium acetate buffer is used to in the soil suspensions and to dissolve the fluorescent substrates @sec-fluo_subs. Adjust the pH with glacial acetic acid to resemble the pH of the soil (pH ≈ 5 for forest O horizon). pH should be below 7.

To prepare 1 l of buffer:

-   Dissolve 4.1015 g of sodium acetate in diH<sub>2</sub>O

-   Adjust pH with glacial acetic acid

*Storage*: +4℃. The buffer can be uses at least a week after preparation.

### Fluorescent substrates (200 µM) {#sec-fluo_subs}

Dissolve the substrates in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer @sec-sodium_acetate. The substrates are difficult to dissolve so you may need to use a water bath at moderate heat and shake them from time to time, or use a sonicator. Calculate how much of each substrate solution you will need for all your samples and prepare solutions in bulk. You can prepare aliquots with enough volume for one or two plates (\~ 5 ml/plate) and store them at -20℃ (for several months).

*Storage*: -20℃ (at least two months).

Formula for calculating amounts of substrate needed:

$$
g_{substrate} = molarity \times volume \times molecular weight
$$

-   CBH (4-MUB-𝛽-D-cellobioside): **1.000 mg/10 ml acetate buffer**

-   BG (4-MUB-𝛽-D-glucopyranoside): **0.676 mg/10 ml acetate buffer**

-   NAG (4-MUB-N-acetyl-𝛽-D-glucosaminide): **0.758 mg/10 ml acetate buffer**

-   CiBH (4-MUB-𝛽-D-N-diacetyl-chitobioside): **1.165 mg/10 ml acetate buffer**

-   aP (4-MUB-phosphate): **0.512 mg/10 ml acetate buffer**

-   BXD (4-MUB-𝛽-D-xylopyranoside): **0.616 mg/10 ml acetate buffer**

-   LAP (L-leucine-7-amido-4-MUC-hydrochloride): **0.649 mg/10 ml acetate buffer**

### Standard solutions  {#sec-standards}

The standard solutions of MUB (for CBH, BG, NAG, CiBH, aP, and BXD) and MUC (for LAP) are used to make standard curves. You only have to do the standard curve once per "assay round". In addition, one point of the standard curve (e.g. 9 µM) should be used for the quenching control, therefore you will need to prepare a larger volume of that concentration.

*Storage*: -20℃ for at least two months

#### Prepare stock solution (1 mM)

-   MUB (4-methylumbelliferone): **8.8085 mg/50 ml acetate buffer**

-   MUC (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin): **8.759 mg/50 ml acetate buffer**

#### Prepare the standard curve  {#sec-standard_curve}

100 µM = 3 ml of stock (1 mM) in 27 ml acetate buffer

90 µM = 27 ml of 100 µM in 3 ml acetate buffer

60 µM = 20 ml of 90 µM in 10 ml acetate buffer

30 µM = 15 ml of 60 µM in 15 ml acetate buffer

9 µM = 9 ml of 30 µM in 21 ml acetate buffer

3 µM = 10 ml of 9 µM in 20 ml acetate buffer

1 µM = 10 ml of 3 µM in 20 ml acetate buffer

0 µM = acetate buffer

### Stop solution, NaOH (0.5 M)

Dissolve 1 g NaOH in 50 ml sodium acetate buffer

*Storage*: +4℃
