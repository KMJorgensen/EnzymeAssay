# Protocols and data management for enzyme assays

This is a repository for storing and sharing protocols and analysis
scripts for enzyme activity assays.

The repository will primarily be used by the Soil Nutrient Cycling group
(SNC) at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU). Contact

### The protocols

The protocols have been developed over several years by members of the
Soil Biology group at SLU. They were re-written in 2023-2024 and
deposited on GitHub. The outlined protocols are based on these sources:

Daniel G, Volc J, Kubatova E. 1994. Pyranose oxidase, a major source of
H2O2 during wood degradation by *Phanerochaete chrysosporium*, *Trametes
versicolor*, and *Oudemansiella mucida*. Applied and Environmental
Microbiology 60: 2524– 2532.

Kyaschenko J, Clemmensen KE, Karltun E, Lindahl BD. 2017. Belowground
organic matter accumulation along a boreal forest fertility gradient
relates to guild interaction within fungal communities. Ecology Letters
20: 1546–1555.

Saiya-Cork KR, Sinsabaugh RL, Zak DR. 2002. The effects of long term
nitrogen deposition on extracellular enzyme activity in an *Acer
saccharum* forest soil. Soil Biology and Biochemistry 34: 1309–1315.

### Analysis scripts

The analysis scripts were developed in 2024 by Karolina Jörgensen and
can be used to clean raw data. Note that they are adapted for the type
of data acquired from the TecanSpark with the settings standardised for
the SNC group att SLU Uppsala and that users may have to adapt it to fit
their own data.
